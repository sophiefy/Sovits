# Configuration File

`sovtis.json` is an example configuration file for training **single speaker** voice conversion.

`sovits_idx.json` is an example configuration file for training **multi-speaker** voice conversion.

You may change the `n_speakers`, `batch_size`, `training_files` and `validation_files` to fit your own dataset!
